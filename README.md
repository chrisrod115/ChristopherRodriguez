## 100 Days of code Udemy learning course

Hello world, this is my 100 days of python programming. I will be adding all of my programs and progress, day by day. Hopefully I will be able to complete this course by the end of this month and will move over to completing a project of my own. 

I am completing this course since I am really invested in programming and love to tinker and make things work. This is my first real shot at programming in python since I have only written code in C. 

Wish me luck!! :)
